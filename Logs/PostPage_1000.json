            "body": "<h1>Pre-contact Native American Cities</h1><p>There were a number of large population centers in the Americas. I will be focusing on those in what is now the US and Canada, but large cities also existed south of the Rio Grande.</p><p>Generally considered the greatest pre-Columbian Native American city, <b>Cahokia </b>once sat directly across the river from what is now St. Louis, Missouri. It was settled around 600 CE and existed from 1050-1350 CE, with its apex around 1100 CE. Cahokia likely had more than 20,000 people living in (thousands more than London, at the time) and was the most influential urban settlement of the Mississippian culture.</p><p>Cahokia, on the Mississippi River, was an important center for trade and agriculture. It maintained trade links with communities from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast and had people living outside the main urban center. Cahokia, and the Mississippians who built it, were known for their incredible urban planning and the mounds that made up the city center. Today, the Cahokia Mounds are a UNESCO World Heritage site. </p><p>Second, the <b>Poverty Point</b> (named after a 19th-century plantation on top of it) culture was centralized in what is now northeastern Louisiana. Like Cahokia, it had a number of important mounds for urban life. It was constructed over multiple generations, and radiocarbon dating suggests that earthwork construction was in progress from 1800-1200 BCE. Poverty Point is one of the most ancient cities in the Americas. Poverty Point had a rich material culture include fired earthware, copperwork, and stone vessels. They had manufacturing and long-distance trade.</p><p>Third, the <b>Calusa </b>(Caloosahatchee) people of the southwest coast of Florida, on the coast of the Gulf. They also built mounds and, at the time of European contact in the 16th century, had a population in the 10,000s. They were likely the only indigenous North Americans who established a kingdom without practicing agriculture, using the abundant fishing resources instead. The main mound, Mound Key, was a manmade structure with canals, watercourts, and other features. The Calusa were notable for their carved-wood art and their sophisticated engineering and architecture. A single manor on Mound Key was capable of holding 2,000 people.</p><p>Fourth, the Mogollon culture was one of the major cultures of southwest America. It had multiple large and dense settlements, but one that&rsquo;s considered a proper city. Called <b>Paquim\u00e9</b>, it was settled from 1130-1450 CE. It had a population in the thousands, who lived in multi-story buildings and an irrigation-based agricultural economy. They had a complex system of water control that included drainage, reservoirs, channels, and sewage. The city had a market, ballcourts, and the production of copper and ceramic objects.</p><p>The final city to discuss is <b>Etzanoa</b>. Located in what is now Arkansas City, Kansas on the Arkansas River, it actually flourished after and alongside European contact, mostly with the Spanish. Etzanoa housed approximately 20,000 people.

It was settled around 600 CE and existed from 1050-1350 CE, with its apex around 1100 CE. Cahokia likely had more than 20,000 people living in (thousands more than London, at the time) and was the most influential urban settlement of the Mississippian culture.</p><p>Cahokia, on the Mississippi River, was an important center for trade and agriculture. It maintained trade links with communities from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast and had people living outside the main urban center. Cahokia, and the Mississippians who built it, were known for their incredible urban planning and the mounds that made up the city center. Today, the Cahokia Mounds are a UNESCO World Heritage site. </p><p>Second, the <b>Poverty Point</b> (named after a 19th-century plantation on top of it) culture was centralized in what is now northeastern Louisiana. Like Cahokia, it had a number of important mounds for urban life. It was constructed over multiple generations, and radiocarbon dating suggests that earthwork construction was in progress from 1800-1200 BCE. Poverty Point is one of the most ancient cities in the Americas. Poverty Point had a rich material culture include fired earthware, copperwork, and stone vessels.

They were likely the only indigenous North Americans who established a kingdom without practicing agriculture, using the abundant fishing resources instead. The main mound, Mound Key, was a manmade structure with canals, watercourts, and other features. The Calusa were notable for their carved-wood art and their sophisticated engineering and architecture. A single manor on Mound Key was capable of holding 2,000 people.</p><p>Fourth, the Mogollon culture was one of the major cultures of southwest America. It had multiple large and dense settlements, but one that\u2019s considered a proper city. Called <b>Paquim\u00e9</b>, it was settled from 1130-1450 CE. It had a population in the thousands, who lived in multi-story buildings and an irrigation-based agricultural economy. They had a complex system of water control that included drainage, reservoirs, channels, and sewage.

It is important to recognize these so you are able to combat them.</p><p>First, consider the &lsquo;pristine myth&rsquo;, that Native Americans were essentially all hunter-gatherers in temporary shelters who did not fundamentally change the environment in which they lived. This is completely false: most tribes were agriculturalists and all tribes deliberately shaped the world in which they lived. Pre-contact Americas were home to beautiful forms of architecture, large cities, and the most advanced urban planning the world had yet seen.</p><p>Second, be aware of small population myths. Hand-in-hand with pristine myths, many assume (and textbooks do little to dissuade) that the Americas were sparsely populated with few people scattered across the continents. While it&rsquo;s uncertain exactly how many people lived here, the Americas had cities larger than European cities. North America has up to 7 million people, and estimates for all of the Americas go up to over 100 million people.</p><p>Third, look out for outside-influence conspiracy theories. Some people claim that the incredible accomplishments could not have been done by Native Americans. Alternate 'theories&rsquo; include aliens, 7th century BCE immigrants from Jerusalem, and 2nd century BCE Minoans (the latter two groups apparently sailed across the Atlantic).</p><p>Fourth, understand the true role of disease decimation in the Americas. While it is absolutely true that the spread of diseases contributed to the population decline, many sources use the passive voice and avoid other details, to make it sound like this was an uncontrollable natural disaster. Colonizers deliberately spread these diseases as a form of biological warfare, and then slaughtered the weakened groups. Do not allow the blame to be shifted away from the colonizers.</p><p>All of these theories uphold the settler-colonial state, benefit White supremacy, and justify the genocide of Native Americans. By arguing that there were few indigenous people who were mostly killed by uncontrollable diseases and that they did not create great civilizations and cultures, it minimizes the harm done by the Native American genocides.</p>",

He worked at the Imperial Observatory on drafting the calendar and studying the armillary sphere (a model of objects in the sky).</p><p>Of note, he was the first person in China to calculate infinite series and he obtained more than 10 formulae. He also first established what would later be called Catalan numbers, a sequence of natural numbers helpful in dealing with recursively define objects. Though these numbers would be named after a European, it was Minggatu who discovered them.
