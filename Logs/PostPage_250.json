Using a term with more than one meaning, and changing which one you mean depending on the situation. The proposed &ldquo;Wall&rdquo; between the United States and Mexico is sometimes an actual wall, sometimes a fence, and sometimes a metaphorical &ldquo;Wall&rdquo; that represents strict immigration polices. This allowed its proponents, like Donald Trump, to be able to take a hardline stance without building a literal wall.</li><li>False dichotomy: Presenting only two options when there are more,&ldquo; either you&rsquo;re with us or against us!&rdquo;</li><li>Incomplete comparison: Making a comparison to nothing, so the claim cannot be effectively argued against. Claiming, for example, that a certain breakfast results in better test scores&ndash;better than what? Other cereals? Things other than cereal? Just not eating?</li><li>Apples and oranges: Comparing things that cannot be compared with validity. Always be suspicious of comparisons&ndash;the reason two things can be compared should be stated and valid by itself. </li><li>Lump of labor fallacy: Arguing that there is a set amount of labor to be done in a certain economy. This is often done by anti-immigration proponents, arguing that they will displace jobs from natives, despite recurring economic evidence that this is not true.</li><li>McNamara fallacy: Overly or only valuing things that can be easily quantified and described when making decisions. Things like emotions, relationships, life experiences all count. Attempting to avoid this fallacy is why many institutions of higher learning are shifting to holistic admission approaches over only using grades and test scores.</li><li>Nirvana fallacy: Rejecting solutions because they aren&rsquo;t perfect, even if they are better than the status quo. This is a common argument against receiving vaccines&ndash;because they are not totally perfect, people suggest they are totally worthless. The nirvana fallacy is related to the concept of false dichotomies.</li><li>Slippery slope fallacy: Suggesting a small action will inevitably lead to more negative ones. You might have heard this one in homophobic and transphobic attacks, connecting increased acceptance of LGBTQ+ lifestyles as beginning a &ldquo;slippery slope&rdquo; to pedophilia and bestiality. However, all evidence suggests that this never happens. It is important to note that some slippery slopes are real&ndash;when making a slippery slope claim, you should always support it with evidence that it has occurred in the past. Unsubstantiated claims can be disregarded, but this one is not always a fallacy</li></ol><p>Always remember that propaganda and misinformation do not need to lie&ndash;they can mislead you with facts just as well. Do not allow other people to guide your thinking, only let them present facts and decide for yourself on your conclusions.</p></p>", "is_current_item": true, "is_root_item": true}], "can_like": true, "interactability_reblog": "everyone", "can_reblog": true, "can_send_in_message": true, "can_reply": true, "display_avatar": true}, {"type": "text", "is_blocks_post_format": true, "blog_name": "dailyhistoryposts", "blog": {"name": "dailyhistoryposts", "title": "History Posts, Daily", "description": "<center>\nFollow for histories, quotes, art and more, daily.\n</center>\n<center>                                                                <a     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
