She was inspired by distant artistic cultures, nature, and the underwater world.

She never stopped working throughout the war, though she was under suspicion and the market for luxury goods was dropped, knowing the business and its workers relied on her.</p><p>On the 2nd of November, 1942, Belperron was arrested for, essentially, allowing a &lsquo;Jewish business&rsquo; to survive. She swallowed the pages of Herz&rsquo;  address book as she was being transferred to the Gestapo. Herz was arrested the same day and sent to Auschwitz, from where he entrusted all his assets and the safety of his children, to Belperron, before dying.
