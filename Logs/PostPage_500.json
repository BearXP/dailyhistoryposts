Termed &ldquo;articles of agreement&rdquo; and often based on privateer codes, they were typically drawn up by a ship&rsquo;s crew after defecting to piracy. The particulars of the code varied from ship to ship, but had commonalities. A pirate would have to sign (or mark, if he couldn&rsquo;t write his name) to be part of the crew. The Pirate Code was far more fair and democratic then privateer and maritime codes; many crews defected into piracy because of their unfairness of life aboard a legal ship.</p><p>One preserved example of a pirate code is that of Captain Bartholomew Roberts (active from 1719-1722). It reads as followed:</p><p><b>I.</b>\u00a0Every man has a vote in affairs of moment; has equal title to the fresh provisions, or strong liquors, at any time seized, and may use them at pleasure, unless a scarcity (not an uncommon thing among them) makes it necessary, for the good of all, to vote a retrenchment.<br/><b>II.</b>\u00a0Every man to be called fairly in turn, by list, on board of prizes because, (over and above their proper share) they were on these occasions allowed a shift of clothes: but if they defrauded the company to the value of a dollar in plate, jewels, or money,\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marooning\">marooning </a>was their punishment. If the robbery was only betwixt one another, they contented themselves with slitting the ears and nose of him that was guilty, and set him on shore, not in an uninhabited place, but somewhere, where he was sure to encounter hardships.<br/><b>III.</b>\u00a0No person to game at cards or dice for money.<br/><b>IV.</b>\u00a0The lights and candles to be put out at eight o'clock at night: if any of the crew, after that hour still remained inclined for drinking, they were to do it on the open deck.<br/><b>V.</b>\u00a0To keep their piece, pistols, and cutlass clean and fit for service.<br/><b>VI.</b>\u00a0No boy or woman to be allowed amongst them. If any man were to be found seducing any of the latter sex, and carried her to sea, disguised, he was to suffer death; (so that when any fell into their hands, as it chanced in the Onslow, they put a sentinel immediately over her to prevent ill consequences from so dangerous an instrument of division and quarrel; but then here lies the roguery; they contend who shall be sentinel, which happens generally to one of the greatest bullies, who, to secure the lady&rsquo;s virtue, will let none lie with her but himself.)<br/><b>VII.</b>\u00a0To desert the ship or their quarters in battle, was punished with death or marooning.<br/><b>VIII.</b>\u00a0No striking one another on board, but every man&rsquo;s quarrels to be ended on shore, at sword and pistol.

Termed \u201carticles of agreement\u201d and often based on privateer codes, they were typically drawn up by a ship\u2019s crew after defecting to piracy. The particulars of the code varied from ship to ship, but had commonalities. A pirate would have to sign (or mark, if he couldn\u2019t write his name) to be part of the crew. The Pirate Code was far more fair and democratic then privateer and maritime codes; many crews defected into piracy because of their unfairness of life aboard a legal ship.</p><p>One preserved example of a pirate code is that of Captain Bartholomew Roberts (active from 1719-1722). It reads as followed:</p><p><b>I.</b>\u00a0Every man has a vote in affairs of moment; has equal title to the fresh provisions, or strong liquors, at any time seized, and may use them at pleasure, unless a scarcity (not an uncommon thing among them) makes it necessary, for the good of all, to vote a retrenchment.<br><b>II.</b>\u00a0Every man to be called fairly in turn, by list, on board of prizes because, (over and above their proper share) they were on these occasions allowed a shift of clothes: but if they defrauded the company to the value of a dollar in plate, jewels, or money,\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marooning\">marooning </a>was their punishment. If the robbery was only betwixt one another, they contented themselves with slitting the ears and nose of him that was guilty, and set him on shore, not in an uninhabited place, but somewhere, where he was sure to encounter hardships.<br><b>III.</b>\u00a0No person to game at cards or dice for money.<br><b>IV.</b>\u00a0The lights and candles to be put out at eight o'clock at night: if any of the crew, after that hour still remained inclined for drinking, they were to do it on the open deck.<br><b>V.</b>\u00a0To keep their piece, pistols, and cutlass clean and fit for service.<br><b>VI.</b>\u00a0No boy or woman to be allowed amongst them. If any man were to be found seducing any of the latter sex, and carried her to sea, disguised, he was to suffer death; (so that when any fell into their hands, as it chanced in the Onslow, they put a sentinel immediately over her to prevent ill consequences from so dangerous an instrument of division and quarrel; but then here lies the roguery; they contend who shall be sentinel, which happens generally to one of the greatest bullies, who, to secure the lady\u2019s virtue, will let none lie with her but himself.)<br><b>VII.</b>\u00a0To desert the ship or their quarters in battle, was punished with death or marooning.<br><b>VIII.</b>\u00a0No striking one another on board, but every man\u2019s quarrels to be ended on shore, at sword and pistol.
