Protestors stayed inside the building for 26 straight days, taking care of each other, including 8 people who went on hunger strikes.

I\u2019ve been trying to get up here all day for your gay brothers and your gay sisters in jail that write me every motherfucking week and ask for your help, and you all don\u2019t do a goddamn thing for them. Have you ever been beaten up and raped in jail? Now think about it. They\u2019ve been beaten up and raped after they\u2019ve had to spend much of their money in jail to get their self home and to try to get their sex changes. The women have tried to fight for their sex changes or to become women of the Women\u2019s Liberation and they write STAR, not to the women\u2019s groups, they do not write to men, they write STAR because we\u2019re trying to do something for them. I have been to jail. I have been raped, and beaten. Many times. By men, heterosexual men that do not belong in the homosexual shelter. But, do you do anything for me? No. Youtell me to go and hide my tail between my legs. I will not put up with this shit. I have been beaten. I have had my nose broken. I have been thrown in jail. I have lost my job. I have lost my apartment for gay liberation and you all treat me this way? What the fuck\u2019s wrong with you all? Think about that! I do not believe in a revolution, but you all do. I believe in the Gay Power. I believe in us getting our rights, or else I would not be out there fighting for our rights. That\u2019s all I wanted to say to you people. If you all want to know about the people in jail \u2013 and do not forget Bambi L\u2019Amour, Andorra Marks, Kenny Messner, and other gay people in jail \u2013 come and see the people at STARHouse on Twelfth Street on 640 East Twelfth Street between B and C apartment 14.
